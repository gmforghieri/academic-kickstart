Hi! I'm Gian Marco.  
  
I am a curious and rebellious individual, I like constantly questioning the status quo and finding ways to better myself and make a positive impact in the world. I am a great believer in lifelong learning and self-development,  thus I spend my days with the intent to challenge myself by expanding my knowledge and limits in a holistic way.  

I finished high school with many questions unanswered, therefore, I went on a journey of self-discovery, to see the world for myself, figure out what I want from my life and explore what I am truly capable of. Since then, I have taken complete ownership of my life and finances, lived in 4 countries, attended 3 higher educational institutions and worked at 4 companies in different roles. 

The experiences I have accumulated and books I’ve read made me realize, that our society is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies. I am excited to be learning new things and work on problems that will help change that.  

I am currently a 2nd year BSc student in computer science & engineering at TU Delft and also working as a junior full stack software engineer to further refine my programming skills.  

I am looking for internship opportunities from 2020 summer onwards, in software development roles with special interest in the following areas:  

  • revolutionizing education  
  
  • solving problems and creating economic value in the investment/algorithmic-trading/FinTech scene  
  
  • contributing to a large-scale software product which serves massive amounts of people worldwide
