Hi! I'm Gian Marco.  
  
I am a curious and rebellious individual, who likes to constantly question the status quo and find new ways to better himself and make a positive impact in the world. I am a great believer in lifelong learning and self-development,  thus I spend my days with the intent to challenge myself by expanding my knowledge and limits in a holistic way.

I finished high school with many questions unanswered, therefore, I went on a journey of self-discovery, to see the world for myself, figure out what I want from my life and explore what I am truly capable of. Since the age of 19, I have taken complete ownership of my life and finances, lived in 4 foreign countries, attended 3 higher educational institutions and worked at 4 companies in different roles.  

The experiences I have accumulated and books Iâ€™ve read made me realize, that our society is flawed in many ways and has an abundance of inefficiencies. I am excited to be learning new things and work on problems that will help change that.
