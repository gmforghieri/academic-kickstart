In this series of blog posts I will attempt to analyze my journey based on the hero myth pattern popularized by Joseph Campbell,
which was influenced by Carl Jung's work on myth and archetypes also known as the ancient patterns of personality traits that are the shared heritage of the human race.
In other words, the hero's journey represents the universal human condition of being born into this world, growing, learning, struggling to become an individual, and dying.

The first part of the story in which we learn about the hero before the real journey begins.
The ordinary world describes the hero's comfort zone, customs, conditioned beliefs and behaviours.
This is where the hero lives before the journey, thus we learn about his everyday life and get a glimpse about his character.

Based on the above, I will attempt to describe how the ordinary world looked like for me and how certain events might have influenced
who I am today.

Coming Soon!
