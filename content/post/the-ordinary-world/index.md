In this series of blog posts I will attempt to analyze my journey based on the hero myth pattern popularized by Joseph Campbell,
which was influenced by Carl Jung's work on myth and archetypes also known as the ancient patterns of personality that are the shared heritage of the human race.
In other words, the hero's journey represents the universal human condition of being born into this world, growing, learning, struggling to become an individual, and dying.
